# STOPWATCH 
This project is a simple stopwatch web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a responsive design, allowing it to adapt to different screen sizes. The main components of the project include:

+ HTML Structure: The HTML file defines the basic structure of the web page, including a container div that holds the stopwatch display and control buttons.
+ CSS Styling: CSS is used to style the elements on the page, including background colors, button styles, and layout. The design is responsive, ensuring it looks good on both small and large screens.
+ Stopwatch Display: The stopwatch display consists of a title ("STOPWATCH") and a timer that shows hours, minutes, and seconds. Initially, the timer displays "00:00:00."
+ Control Buttons: There are three control buttons: START, STOP, and RESET. When users hover over the buttons, they change color from orange to red. Clicking these buttons initiates various stopwatch actions, such 
  as starting, stopping, and resetting the timer.
+ JavaScript Functionality: JavaScript adds interactivity to the stopwatch. It handles the timer logic and button click events, allowing users to control the stopwatch's behavior.
+ Responsive Design: The stopwatch is designed to be responsive, adjusting its layout and font sizes based on the screen size. This ensures a consistent user experience across different devices.
